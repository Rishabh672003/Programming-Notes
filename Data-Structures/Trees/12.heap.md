### Heap (Priority Queue)

A **heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure used primarily for efficient access to the maximum or minimum
element. It is often implemented as a binary tree and can be used to maintain a priority queue, which allows for quick
retrieval of the highest or lowest priority element.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Purpose**

   - Heaps are used to get the minimum or maximum element from a collection in constant time, O(1).
   - Insertion and deletion of elements are performed in logarithmic time, O(log n).

2. **Types of Heaps**
   - **Min-Heap**: The root node is the smallest element, and every parent node is less than or equal to its children.
   - **Max-Heap**: The root node is the largest element, and every parent node is greater than or equal to its children.

### Heap Properties

1. **Structure Property**

   - The heap is a **complete binary tree**, meaning all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level,
     which must be filled from left to right.
   - This ensures efficient use of space and enables fast access to elements.

2. **Order Property**
   - In a **min-heap**, the value of the root node is smaller than both its children.
   - In a **max-heap**, the value of the root node is larger than both its children.

#### Example of a Min-Heap:

```
                         14
                        /  \
                       19   16
                      /  \
                     21   26
```

### Differences from Binary Search Tree (BST)

- **Duplicates**: Heaps can contain duplicate values, whereas BSTs do not allow duplicate nodes.
- **Ordering**: In a heap, only the parent-child relationship matters for ordering. In a BST, all nodes in the left
  subtree are smaller than the root, and all nodes in the right subtree are larger.

### Array Representation of Heaps

A heap is generally implemented using an array. Given the complete binary tree property, the elements can be stored in
an array such that:

- The **root** is at index 1 (index 0 is typically unused).
- For any node at index i:
  - The **left child** is at index 2i.
  - The **right child** is at index 2i + 1.
  - The **parent** is at index i // 2.

#### Example Array Representation:

For the tree:

```
                          14
                         🯖   \
                       19    16
                      /  \
                     21   26
```

The array representation would be:

```
    0    1    2   3    4    5   
 ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
 │    │ 14 │ 19 │ 16 │ 21 │ 26 │
 └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘
```

### Heap Operations

1. **Insert Operation (`push`)**

   - Insert a new element at the end of the array.
   - **Percolate up** (or bubble up) the element to restore the heap property by comparing the element with its parent
     and swapping if necessary.
   - Time complexity: O(\log n), where n is the number of elements.

2. **Delete Operation (`pop`)**

   - Remove the root element (either the minimum or maximum).
   - Replace the root with the last element in the heap.
   - **Percolate down** (or bubble down) the root element to restore the heap property by comparing with its children
     and swapping if necessary.
   - Time complexity: O(log n).

### Python Implementation of Heap

```python
class Heap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = [0]  # Initialize heap with a dummy element at index 0

    def push(self, val):
        # Insert new value at the end
        self.heap.append(val)
        i = len(self.heap) - 1

        # Percolate up
        while i > 1 and self.heap[i] < self.heap[i // 2]:
            self.heap[i], self.heap[i // 2] = self.heap[i // 2], self.heap[i]
            i //= 2  # Move to the parent node

    def pop(self):
        if len(self.heap) == 1:
            return None  # Heap is empty

        if len(self.heap) == 2:
            return self.heap.pop()  # Only one element

        res = self.heap[1]  # The root value (min or max)
        self.heap[1] = self.heap.pop()  # Replace root with the last element
        i = 1

        # Percolate down
        while 2 * i < len(self.heap):
            # Check if right child exists and is smaller than the left child
            if 2 * i + 1 < len(self.heap) and self.heap[2 * i + 1] < self.heap[2 * i]:
                # Swap with right child if needed
                if self.heap[i] > self.heap[2 * i + 1]:
                    self.heap[i], self.heap[2 * i + 1] = self.heap[2 * i + 1], self.heap[i]
                    i = 2 * i + 1
                else:
                    break
            # Otherwise, swap with the left child
            elif self.heap[i] > self.heap[2 * i]:
                self.heap[i], self.heap[2 * i] = self.heap[2 * i], self.heap[i]
                i = 2 * i
            else:
                break

        return res

    def heapify(self, arr):
        # Convert any array into a heap
        arr = [0] + arr  # Add dummy element at index 0
        self.heap = arr
        cur = (len(self.heap) - 1) // 2  # Start with the first non-leaf node

        while cur > 0:
            # Percolate down
            i = cur
            while 2 * i < len(self.heap):
                if 2 * i + 1 < len(self.heap) and self.heap[2 * i + 1] < self.heap[2 * i]:
                    if self.heap[i] > self.heap[2 * i + 1]:
                        self.heap[i], self.heap[2 * i + 1] = self.heap[2 * i + 1], self.heap[i]
                        i = 2 * i + 1
                    else:
                        break
                elif self.heap[i] > self.heap[2 * i]:
                    self.heap[i], self.heap[2 * i] = self.heap[2 * i], self.heap[i]
                    i = 2 * i
                else:
                    break
            cur -= 1
```

### Time Complexities

- **Insertion (`push`)**: O(log n)
- **Deletion (`pop`)**: O(log n)
- **Heapify**: O(n) – It can convert any array into a heap efficiently.
